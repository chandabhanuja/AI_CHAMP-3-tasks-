I am from a computer sciencebackground but keenly interested into business, this has led toa special bond in my brain that makes me link every technicalopportunity to a business opportunity. I have worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Intel at high endtechnologies with genius minds towards a new innovative tech drivenfuture. Challenges are something that makes me go crazy. And atIntel, my each and every day used to be filled with challenges tomeet up with industry standard and always keep on learning newthings to be updated with technology. I have been an entrepreneur since very childhood. I used to sell inksin school for small pennies as in our school we were only allowed touse ink pens and not the ball pens. Also in my school days I havebeen involved in lending out my bicycles to other fellow students whodidn't had a bicycle at that time. These were some small activitieshow I started my interest in business. Now speaking of my actual,legal previous experience, in my class 12th, I founded FolleryPvt Ltd, an E-commerce company that was dealing with Fine Artproducts. To some extent this was going well but I faced problemsin scaling this up. This was my successful failure experience whereI learned two things - Importance of Market Understanding andImportance of a strong Team. After this I also worked on two morebusiness one in Healthcare sector and another in Digital Magazinebut both ended up to be a good learning and experience for me. Health, Education, Sanitation and Latest Techs, these are the majordomains of my interest and most of my work has always been inthese sectors. My capability to grasp things fast and to work tillperfection makes me capable of taking up any kind of work andexcelling in that. I am always up for any kind of collaboration andprojects in any of the above mentioned domain.   Page 1 of 2mailto:kamal.dev9339@gmail.comhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/kamal-dev?jobid=1234&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_jobs_easyapply_pdfgenresume%3B8gaL8wEGQCmVsTQbL%2F4seA%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_jobs_easyapply_pdfgenresume-v02_profilehttps://www.linkedin.com/in/kamal-dev?jobid=1234&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_jobs_easyapply_pdfgenresume%3B8gaL8wEGQCmVsTQbL%2F4seA%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_jobs_easyapply_pdfgenresume-v02_profile   ExperienceAlpyus TechnologiesCo-FounderJuly 2020 - Present (2 months)Bengaluru, Karnataka, IndiaIntel CorporationSoftware Engineer InternJuly 2019 - June 2020 (1 year)Bengaluru Area, IndiaJapan Third PartyHumanoid Developer InternMarch 2019 - April 2019 (2 months)Follery Pvt.
